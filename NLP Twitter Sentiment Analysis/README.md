# NLP Twitter Sentiment Analysis
In this project, I trained a Naive Bayes classifier to predict sentiment from thousands of Twitter tweets. This project could be practically used by any company with social media presence to automatically predict customer's sentiment (i.e.: whether their customers are happy or not). The process could be done automatically without having humans manually review thousands of tweets and customer reviews. 

# Objectives
- Perform exploratory data analysis and plot word-cloud
- Apply Python libraries to import and visualize dataset
- Evaluate the performance of trained Naïve Bayes Classifier model using confusion matrices.
- Train Naïve Bayes classifier models using Scikit-Learn to preform classification
- Perform Count Vectorization (Tokenization) to tweet text using Scikit Learn
- Perform text data cleaning such as removing punctuation and stop words
